/*Brother Odom:

I tried several different approaches to tackle this part of the assignment. I spent about 4 hours in part alone. 
Seems like no matter how I introduce the formula, the result is always the same. I also tried using the wind chill formula
from CIT160, without success. I know the formula works.

I also checked the console to make sure I was  getting the right data from the summary. And I was.

I'm dissapointed that this script doesn't work properly. Can you help me figure out what I did worng?*/

//A COUPLE FORMULAS I TRIED:

// var wchill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temp) - (35.75 * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)) + (0.4275 * (temp * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)));

/*
function windChill(tempF, speed){
    var wchill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temp) - (35.75 * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)) + (0.4275 * (temp * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)));
    return wchill;
}
*/

/*var wchill = 0;
console.log("Init wchill " + wchill);
wchill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temp);
console.log("Windchill 1 " + wchill);

wchill = wchill - (35.75 * Math.pow(speed, 0.16));
console.log("Windchill 2 " + wchill);

wchill = wchill + (0.4275 * (temp * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)));
console.log("Windchill 3 " + wchill);

wchill = Math.round(wchill);*/



/* LAST FORMULA I USED
var wchill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temp) - (35.75 * (Math.pow(speed, 0.16))) + 0.4275 * temp * (Math.pow(speed, 0.16));*/


 /*CORRECT FORMULA BY BROTHER ODOM, SAME RESULT*/ 
var wchill = 35.74 + (0.6215 * temp) - (35.75 * Math.pow(speed, 0.16)) + (0.4275 * temp) * Math.pow(speed, 0.16);


wchill = Math.round(wchill);


document.getElementById("summary3").innerHTML = wchill;
